            <h2>Cat-Scratcher 3000</h2>
                <p>I had invigorated and tested the ultimate cat-scratching device, the Cat-Scratcher 3000.
            Developed after 30 years(cat years) of testing different materials including couch stuffings,
            carpet, and other furry things, we grafted the best materials in this device and created
            one of the most highest-grossing product in the world of cats.

            <h2>Social Media Influencer</h2>
            <p>Since becoming an internet sensation only a couple months 
            after being born, I became the face of many popular projects 
            and memes. I have become worldwide known and have many brand 
            deals such as shirts, coffee mugs and other fun things.

            <h2>Operation Overload</h2>
            <p>
                Being an operations manager, I helped operate the biggest expansion of Grumpy Productions.
                Working with a small team of 3 in Grumpy Productions, I headed the coastal expansion of our Western
                division of operations. Managing the infrastructure of our stores, the IT team located in Fremont, CA,
                and amassing and overseeing the budget of each territory in the Western division, I helped grow profit margins of
                over 6% and that division still has the best overall project margin of any division.
